# Predator/Prey Simulator

This is a small scala/swing app that simulates the classic predator prey environment.  I'm working on this primarily to learn about scala with a fun, small project.

## Building

The only dependency is the [typesafe activator](https://typesafe.com/activator).  All other dependencies should be automatically downloaded.  To build:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sizezero/predator-prey.git predator-prey
$ cd predator-prey
$ activator compile
$ activator run
```
